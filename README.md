# Data mining exhibition programs

Exhibition of usage for various data mining algorithms and methods.

## kmeans_clustering_cosine_similarity.py
* Conversion of document data to matrix of tf-idf (term frequency times inverse document frequency) features.
* Normalization of the matrix.
* K-means clustering with cosine similarity as metric.	
* Printing of the percentage of each category in each cluster.

## kfold_metrics.py
* Conversion of document data to matrix of tf-idf (term frequency times inverse document frequency) features.
* Normalization of the matrix.
* Classification methods: Support Vector Machines(SVN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Naive Bayes.
* K-fold cross validation (k=10).
* Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure.
* Prediction with the best classification based on accuracy.

## classification.py
* Conversion of categorical values to numerical.
* Conversion of numerical values to categorical (useful for the information gain).
* Classification methods: Support Vector Machines(SVN), Random Forests, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-nearest Neighbor.
* K-fold cross validation (k=10).
* Prediction with the best classification based on accuracy.
* Information gain for each attribute.
